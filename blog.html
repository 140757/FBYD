  <h1> Snack Workout Five Ways </h1>
  <h5>- Effective exercises to train your belly’s flexibility!</h5>
	<img class="burgerworkout" src="images/burger-workingout.jpeg" alt="burger">
 It doesn't matter how you look at it, you won't get a perfect belly by itself. We at FBYD as a “Fatness Buddy” understand that better than anyone. Perseverance, consistency and attention is what it takes to achieve your personal goals. So don't hope that you will see results from those hard efforts in a week. Also, don't assume that you already look like Robert Jenssen after one of these workouts. This of course sounds terribly demotivating. It is and we understand that.
Fatness Buddy helps you with recipes, workouts and inspiration. We do everything we can to get you in shape as easily as possible. Anything for that killer belly!<br><br>
	<strong>1. Go XXL!</strong>
<p>During these exercises you make 2 sets of 10 bites each. Rest for 20 seconds between each set.
1. Order a Frikandel XXL at the snack bar, have half filled with special sauce. Have the other half filled with peanut sauce.
2. Wait outside with a cigarette until the frikandel is ready to take away
3. Take your bag and tear open the package.
4. Now the real work begins, lick the excess sauce off the paper package first
5. Start at one end, take 1 bite. Then grab a bite on the other side. Repeat this 5 times. Wait 20 seconds. Take 5 more bites left and right.
6. Rinse with energy drink or Mountain Dew.
Ready? Rest for two minutes, then move on to the next exercise.
	</p>
 <strong>2. Make it Crunch</strong>
<p>During these exercises you make 8 sets of 2 Crunchwraps each. Rest for 20 seconds between each set.
Go to the nearest Mexican restaurant.
	</p>
<ol>
<li> Order 16 Crunch Wrap Supreme’s at TacoBell.</li>
<li> Opt for extra cheese sauce</li>
<li> You are now going to eat 2 crunch wraps per set</li>
<li> Make sure you don't need more than 3 bites to eat 1 crunchwap.</li>
<li> You perform the exercise well if you finish the sets within 20 seconds.</li>
<li> Make sure to dip the wrap well in the cheese sauce before every bite.</li>
 </ol>
* Or look at Thuisbezorgd or Deliveroo of course
Ready? Rest for two minutes, then move on to the next exercise.<br><br>
 <strong>3.Cheese Plank(ing)</strong>
During this exercise you will eat one cheese board in 2 times. Rest for 20 seconds between attempts.
Lie on your stomach.
<ol>
<li> Place your forearms on the floor and make sure your elbow is exactly under your shoulder. Your chest should now be off the ground.</li>
<li> Then lift the cheese board. If your lower back is bothering you, go back to your stomach.</li>
<li> Slide the plank in about halfway</li>
<li> Rest for 20 seconds and rinse mouth with red port.</li>
<li> Get back into position and devour the rest of the cheese board!</li>
</ol>
Too easy? Then stick half a board to it, or rinse with extra red port.
Ready? Rest for two minutes, then move on to the next exercise.<br><br>
<strong>4.They Sush Me Rolling..</strong>
<p>During this exercise you make 2 sushi tempura rolls of 10 pieces each. Rest for 20 seconds between the sushi tempura rolls. During the break you rinse your throat with a delicious sake of course.</p>	
<ol>
<li> Take a plate with 10 pieces on it</li>
<li> Place the wheel or barbell on the floor and get on your knees in front of the wheel or barbell.</li>
<li> Grasp the wheel or barbell shoulder-width apart.</li>
<li> Roll forward slowly keeping your arms and back straight and tighten your abs very well.</li>
<li> Roll forward as far as possible and then slowly roll back to the starting position.</li>
</ol>
Ready? Rest for two minutes, then move on to the next exercise.<br>
<br>
	<strong>5. Twist it</strong>
<p>During these exercises you do 2 sets of 20 repetitions each. You rest for 20 seconds between sets.</p>
<ol> 
<li> Lie on your back on the floor and lift your head and shoulders off the floor. Cross your fingers together and keep your arms straight out in front of your chest.</li>
<li> Keep your knees bent 90 degrees and clamp your feet underneath something. For example under a barbell or the edge of the sofa.</li>
<li> Rotate your chest to the left so that your right shoulder moves towards your left knee. Tighten your abdominal muscles. Make sure to lift your left shoulder off the ground.</li>
<li> Hang around the peak for about 2 seconds, then gently return to the starting position. When you come back, your shoulders should not touch the floor and you should not relax your abs. Then you do the same, but then move your left shoulder to your right knee. Left - right = 1 repetition.</li>
<li> Roll forward as far as possible and then slowly roll back to the starting position.</li>
</ol>
Ready? Rest for two minutes, then move on to the next exercise.
