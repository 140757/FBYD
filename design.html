	<h1>Logo</h1>
<b> The brand is a chain of snack bars who serve comfort food to big groups of people. Since the brand values talk about “enjoyment” and “in the moment”, we decided to take a controversial approach with the logo.  By adding a fitness icon at the bottom, which could be perceived as the “you die” part of the brand name. In small words, were trying to communicate “enjoy food instead of being hard on yourself with exercising”.  The logo consists of only the brand name, text wise. The reason for this is that the name of the brand works perfect as a slogan. In that case we decided to only keep that as text.  The logo as said before is a logotype/wordmark, font-based and focuses on the brand name alone. The colors are bold, black, and white. The intention behind the colors is to create a “in your face” effect. Since our values talk about you only live once we specifically want to show some boldness and aggression. Some of our inspirations for the logo design were fast food chains and fitness companies.</b>

<h3> Color Scheme </h3>

	<b>
	The color scheme focuses on the warm colors. The main color is red, combined with sub colors; white, black, orange. Warm colors are very exciting and bright, and they provide a lot of visual stimulation for your guests. But, because these colors are so bright, they can become irritating after a long period of time. This helps to increase your turnover rate, which makes warm color schemes ideal for high-volume establishments like fast causal eateries, buffets, or fast-food restaurants. But, because warm color schemes can be overwhelming, you do not want to overdo it.</b>
<b>
1.	Red
Effect: Red increases your guests' heart rates and can make them hungry. It can also make your guests eat quickly and leave, which is useful for increasing your table turnover rate.
Establishments that should use this color:
Fast food restaurants
Fast casual restaurants
Establishments that want a high table turnover<br><br>

2.	Orange
Effect: Orange makes people feel happy and cheerful. It's also excellent for establishments that serve desserts or unhealthy food because it makes people content and less likely to feel guilty for eating poorly.
Establishments that should use orange:
Fast food restaurants
Ice cream shops
Casual eateries

	<h3> UI Test Results </h3>
	<b>The method used for this project in order to gather testing feedbacks from users was done through sending a digital prototype of the website, made with Power Point, to several testers/potential customers.
The prototype was sent, as a PowerPoint file, to 5 testers in total, via Email and/or WhatsApp. After reviewing it and putting together their thoughts about it, each feedback statement was sent back via email and/or WhatsApp as text and voice message, varying from user to user.
First, they were presented with an explanation about what the website consists of and the goal behind it. Afterwards, they were allowed to have as much time as they wanted to browse through the prototype file and, in case it was needed, had their questions regarding the prototype answered.
We believe that this way keeps the testers more comfortable to review our potential product and think through what is their opinion about it, giving an even more valuable feedback.

		In general, the feedbacks had a very positive outcome, however issues were pointed out and aesthetic advice have risen. Overall, great input from the testers and the information gathered was useful to the construction of a better website.<br>
Many things were adapted based on the feedback, such as the following: A different background, make all images same size and fix margins for a cleaner look, putting a title on every page, adding a contact form, and explain the brand mission in the home page.
