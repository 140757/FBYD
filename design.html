<h1>Design Justifications</h1>
<p>For this platform, we decided to go for an athmosphere that makes you feel like your actually in a fast-food and/orcafeteria establishment. Besides that, it is important to overdo this looks and feel to make the message even come across even stronger. The justifications for all choices made for this website can be found below.</p>

<h3> Flow Diagram and Prototype</h3>
<img src="images/flow-diagram.png" alt="flow-diagram" class="responsive">
<p>We decided to go for a more platform style approach to actually keep people engaged to the brand. Therefore, several blogs recipes and a bingo contest can be found on the website providing new content every week.</p>

<h3> Color Scheme </h3>
<img src="images\colorscheme.png"alt="colorscheme" class="responsive">
<p>
Warm Color Scheme + Black
Colors: Yellow, terracotta, orange, red, gold
Warm colors are very exciting and bright, and they provide a lot of visual stimulation for your guests. But, because these colors are so bright, they can become irritating after a long period of time. This helps to increase your turnover rate, which makes warm color schemes ideal for high-volume establishments like fast causal eateries, buffets, or fast food restaurants. But, because warm color schemes can be overwhelming, you don't want to overdo it.	
</p>
<p>
	<b>Red</b> increases your guests' heart rates and can make them hungry. It can also make your guests eat quickly and leave, which is useful for increasing your table turnover rate.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Orange</b> makes people feel happy and cheerful. It's also excellent for establishments that serve desserts or unhealthy food because it makes people content and less likely to feel guilty for eating poorly.
</p>
<p>
	Some shades of <b>bright yellow</b> have a similar impact as orange, making people happy and content. Generally, yellow is very vibrant and exciting, so it's not an ideal choice for relaxed environments.

<h3> Logo </h3>
<img src="images/LOGO_FBYD.jpg" alt="logo" class="responsive">
<p> For the logo, we decided to make it satirical by implying that it is a fitlife platform tricking people to actually read what the text says. Some poeple would kill for an athletic body while we believe that you <u>need</u> to cheat and enjoy every now and then.</p>
<h3> UI Test Results </h3>
<p>The method that has been used (taking COVID into account) is a PowerPoint format shared through Microsoft Teams with users from the target group between 25-35 years old.</p>
